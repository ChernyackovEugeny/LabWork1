This report describes the implementation and parallelization of the Gaussian blur functionality in the Rotatebmp class using OpenMP. The Gaussian blur algorithm is applied to a BMP image to achieve smoothing and noise reduction. It works by convolving a pixel and its surrounding neighbors with a Gaussian kernel, which effectively averages nearby values while giving higher importance to pixels near the center.

The original implementation used nested loops to compute the convolution for each pixel, which is computationally intensive, especially for large images. To enhance performance, the outer loop over image rows was parallelized using OpenMP's #pragma omp parallel for directive. This change allows each thread to process an entire row independently, as each pixel's computation is isolated and does not interfere with others. The input buffer is shared read-only, and the output buffer is written independently per thread, which ensures thread safety and avoids data races.

The performance was measured using the std::chrono library. The speedup was noticeable in practice, confirming the benefit of parallel execution. Parallelization is especially effective when the image resolution is high and the kernel size is non-trivial.

In conclusion, OpenMP provided an easy and efficient way to parallelize the Gaussian blur algorithm without requiring major structural changes. The function is now capable of taking full advantage of modern multi-core CPUs, resulting in faster execution while preserving correct and predictable output. The combination of algorithmic structure and OpenMP makes this implementation both efficient and reliable.
