This report describes the implementation and parallelization of the Gaussian blur functionality in the Rotatebmp class using OpenMP. The Gaussian blur algorithm is applied to a BMP image to achieve smoothing and noise reduction. It works by convolving each pixel with a Gaussian kernel that computes a weighted average of neighboring pixels, with weights based on the distance from the center.

Originally, the algorithm used nested loops to process each pixel sequentially, which is computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution images. To improve performance, OpenMP was used to parallelize the outer loop responsible for iterating through image rows. This was done with the #pragma omp parallel for directive. Each thread processes a separate row, making the parallelization safe and efficient: the input image buffer is only read, and the output buffer is written independently by each thread.

The performance impact was measured using the std::chrono library. Without parallelization, the Gaussian blur function took 48 milliseconds to complete. After introducing OpenMP-based parallelization, the execution time was reduced to 29 milliseconds, resulting in a significant speedup of over 39%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of OpenMP in reducing computation time for pixel-wise image processing tasks.

In summary, the addition of OpenMP parallelization substantially improved the runtime performance of the Gaussian blur algorithm with minimal code changes. The implementation remains correct, deterministic, and now better utilizes multi-core processor capabilities.
